# JavaScript Projects
This is a repo for the five JavaScript projects in the freeCodeCamp curriculum. These projects include: a palindrome checker, a Roman numeral converter, a Caesar cipher, a telephone number validator, and a cash register. This repo will also be used to help me learn Git and how it works with GitHub.
